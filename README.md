# Iris-Flower-classification
Iris flower classification on a Iris dataset.
Sure, let's break down the explanation in detail:

### Data Collection:
We used the Iris dataset, which is available in the Scikit-learn library. This dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features are used to classify the flowers into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

### Data Preprocessing:
Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. This step ensures that the model can be evaluated on data it hasn't seen before. We used an 80-20 split, where 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is used for testing.

### Feature Standardization:
To ensure the features are on a similar scale, we performed standardization. This process transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Standardization is crucial for algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) because they rely on distance calculations, and having features on different scales can lead to biased results.

### Model Training:
We chose the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for this classification task. KNN is a simple and effective classification algorithm that predicts the class of a data point by looking at the classes of its nearest neighbors. We initialized the KNN classifier with `n_neighbors` set to 3, meaning the algorithm will consider the three nearest neighbors to make a prediction. The model was then trained on the standardized training data.

### Model Evaluation:
After training the model, we made predictions on the test set. The accuracy of the model was calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels of the test set. Accuracy is a common metric to evaluate classification models and represents the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.

In summary, the process involves loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training a KNN classifier, and evaluating its performance. This methodology provides a straightforward and effective approach to classifying iris flowers based on their features. If you need any further clarification or additional details, feel free to ask!
